# MAZESOLVER

This is a script/application for me <Hans Ã…ge Martinsen> to learn a little more about pygame and AI/ML.
The idea is to create something that generates a maze and then lets an AI/ML train on that maze to solve it.

The maze generation stuff is a fork of StanislavPetrovV/Maze_Game. You can find
an exact copy of the code I forked in the Maze_Game branch.
